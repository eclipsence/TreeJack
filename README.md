- **JSON Editor**: Modify your decision tree structures directly in JSON format.
- **Flowchart Representation**: Visualize complex decision-making processes in a straightforward manner.

## Technologies Used

TreeJack leverages several powerful technologies to deliver a smooth user experience:

- **Frontend**: React for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for fast and efficient server-side operations.
- **Visualization**: D3.js for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- **Data Management**: JSON for tree structure representation.
- **System Design**: Structured to handle various user inputs and scenarios.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can access the TreeJack interface through your web browser. Hereâ€™s how to make the most of it:

1. **Load a Decision Tree**: Use the JSON editor to load an existing decision tree or create a new one.
2. **Visualize**: The decision tree will be displayed graphically. Click on nodes to explore paths.
3. **Simulate Inputs**: Enter different input scenarios to see how the decision tree responds.
4. **Debugging**: Identify any unreachable paths and correct them as needed.
